# This Is Only For Windows
### To use it with Linux, I think changing the debug type from vsdbg to something else and the console option in launch.json should be enough... i think.

<b>NOTE:</b> <br>
<b> If you are using windows </b>
<i>and if You Don't Have Git Bash Installed (You Probably Do If You Cloned This Project) <br>
but if you don't then install it. it's useful. or in settings.json change the default terminal setting to what you like or just delete that line and it will go back to default.</i>
